v1.0 init
v1.1 Fix some fatal problems and add more networks
       Fix bugs:
           DPRNN models cannot save weights caused by a Lambda layer.
           A Lambda layer that slices specific channel of data does not run correctly.
           A sample of s3 is mislabeled in file "data_dir_tree.md". Fortunately, this mistake did not affect the results of previous experiments.
           A default path of data in file "data_dir_tree.md" is wrong.
           A bug about input of decoder in model 8.
           Some models are not compatible with specific batch size.
       New features:
           Add "environment.yml" for linux os.
v1.2 Fix some problems and add some new features
       Fix bugs:
           Remove normalization layers in Algorithm 2 (search encoded vectors).
           Add 'tanh' activation function on output layer of TCN.
       New features:
           Add TensorFlow 2.x support.
           Add more violin plots of metrics.
           Add more results of experiments.
v1.3 Fix some problems and add more experiments
       Fix bugs:
           Fix dataset splitting for separation with unknown numbers.
           Add AE models parameter "output_activation", fix related results.
       New features:
           Add experiments separation using autoencoder-separator approach with known numbers.
